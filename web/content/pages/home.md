This is a work-in-progress guide to web scraping as an artistic and critical practice, created by <a href="https://lav.io">Sam Lavigne</a>.

**Schedule:** Every few days I'll upload some new resources and videos to this page. I'll also be doing occasional live demos either on Twitch or YoutTube. You can sign up to receive
updates at: <a href="https://tinyletter.com/scrapism">https://tinyletter.com/scrapism</a>

**Prerequisites:** Please note that this guide is intended for those with some basic programming experience. You definitely don't have to be a pro (I'm not), but you should know what a variable is. To that end, the first two sections act as brief overviews/refreshers of important topics you'll need to be able to follow the rest of the guide.
